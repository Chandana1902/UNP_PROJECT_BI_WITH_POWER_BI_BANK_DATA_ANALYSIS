# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_BANK_DATA_ANALYSIS

I completed a Power BI project in collaboration with UNP, where I developed an interactive Banking Analytics Dashboard to deliver actionable insights across key banking operations. The project encompassed end-to-end data handling — from data cleaning and transformation to advanced modeling — leveraging DAX functions to build calculated measures that surfaced meaningful business intelligence. The dashboard featured multiple focused report pages including Banking Overview, Customer & Branch Analysis, Customer Financial Overview, and Transaction Analysis, each tailored to address specific decision-making needs. Dynamic filters and slicers were integrated to enhance user interactivity and enable seamless data exploration. Through this experience, I strengthened my core competencies in data visualization, analytical thinking, and BI reporting — consistently focusing on translating raw data into structured, strategic insights that support informed business decisions.
